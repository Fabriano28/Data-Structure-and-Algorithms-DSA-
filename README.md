# Back to Basic

This is for me to re-learn Data Structure and Algorithm (DSA) in other languages. I had learned all of this in college using C and C++, however, I would like to jog my memory while implementing specific languages syntax or features onto the algorithm. For example; C and C++ does not support directly swapping values while JavaScript does ([a, b] = [b, a]).

## Why do this?

I usually used C/C++ for algorithms/leetcodes and I've work experience with Swift. I made the mistake of not uploading my college assignments so I do need to redo DSA due to lost files. Also, I'm transitioning to Web Development and foundation in JavaScript is something I noticed I lacked. Doing DSA is the best way I can think of and while I would probably not use these algorithms in future projects, it's nice having done this in the past for those edge cases that do need these. I also have plans to try other languages in the future so all of that will go here too.

## What am I learning?

I used W3School as a guideline of which topics I should learn, here's what to expect of each language:
